TTD to OpenTTD
Transition Guide
This guide gives you pointers in making the transition from TTD to OpenTTD.  Once OpenTTD matures more, this guide will grow.  For now, here are the major differences that I’ve seen.
* Being able to resize the window so that "full-screen" can also show so much more of the land
* Command Line switches to make things easier
* Generate Random Land in the scenario editor also builds small towns, forests, and industries
* A configuration screen that lets you turn on / off TTD Patch features
Some day, OpenTTD will contain the features of TTD Patch.
