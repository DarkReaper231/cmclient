Prepared by Novapolis Team http://www.novapolis.net

== ATTENTION ==
The client circumvents the OpenTTD version checks to be able to join unpatched multiplayer games.
Because of this, if you encounter any bug, report it to Novapolis team as it may be connected to patches included.
Unless you encouter the same bug on unpatched OpenTTD client do not report it to OpenTTD development team.


== INSTALL ==
If you have shared OpenTTD folder, you can just unzip anywhere and launch
If you dont use shared folder, unzip into your OpenTTD folder
innerhighlight.grf in data folder is required, copy it to data or content_download/data folder

== PRO INSTALL ==
WINDOWS
Possible situations:
1) Installing stable release from openttd.org, install also with graphics and sound sets (only graphic are required)
	Install the package. It will create game files in %Program Files%/OpenTTD and user files in %USER_PROFILE%/Documents/OpenTTD
	To gain advantage of shared folder, copy all files except LANG folder and OPENTTD.EXE from %Program Files%/OpenTTD to %USER_PROFILE%/Documents/OpenTTD
	Now if you can unzip this client anywhere and if openttd.exe stays with its lang/folder, you can launch it from any place
	This will also you enable you to use any number or openttd versions/clients
2) Installing stable release from zip
	Download zip and also graphics set zip.
	Unzip both into the same folder. Graphics set belong to BASESET or DATA folder
	Launch the openttd.exe (if there is openttd.cfg already, delete it)
	Quit OpenTTD. Now it created user files in your User profile
	Copy all files except LANG folder and OPENTTD.EXE into User profile folder called OpenTTD
	This will enable you to use any number or openttd versions/clients under condition you keep openttd.exe and its lang files in one folder (every client comes with binary and lang folder at least)
LINUX
Novapolis does not ship linux client. Your only chance is to compile it by yourself.
Process is easy and simple guide is at http://wiki.openttd.org/Compiling_on_(GNU/)Linux_and_*BSD
If you can use Linux, you can compile OpenTTD too

== LOGIN SYSTEM ==
Community Login system - login window
- Please read carefully about new login system if you intend to use it
- new login system for Novapolis and also for n-ice and BTPro, login date are stored in new config file novapolis.cfg
	- login window can be opened via landinfo dropdown mene or a hotkey can be associated with it, for example CTRL+L

	- login is saved by entering text via OpenTTD forms. Remember that OpenTTD shows real letters when entering any text
	- novapolis password is stored encrypted and login string is sent via ingame chat privately to server
		so no one can see it
	- n-ice and BTPro uses token system. In order to retrieve the token, client has to log to their websites
		obtain the token here and enter it in ingame chat
		Alternatively both communities implemented a system, that one can open a dedicated webpage
		and enter username and password there to obtain the token, which is used in n-ice and BTPro
		patched OpenTTD client and Novapolis client uses it too.
		Once token is retrieved, it is sent via ingame chat privately to server
		so no one can see it

		!!! Be aware, that the token login webpage needs decrypted password, so this decrypted password
		is stored in novapolis.cfg file and send decrypted via OpenTTD to their website
		Thus do not provide novapolis.cfg file to any one!
		N-ice and BTPro are 3rd side and Novapolis cannot guarantee safety of the login to their community
		and should they change the login system, Novapolis client login will not work for both of them

== SCRIPTS ==
autoexec.scr contains some predefined aliases for connecting on Novapolis server
In game press ~ (above tab key) and write "nova+<number>", e.g. "nova1". This will connect you to desired server
This is usable for any OpenTTD servers

If you want to use login alias, you will have to rewrite "nick" and "password" to your actual Novapolis account.
However bear in mind, if you accidentally launch this alias on another server, you will uncover your password


== OPENTTD.CFG ==
In openttd.cfg.example are lines you can add to your openttd.cfg to have Novapolis servers available in multiplayer menu all the time without searching for games
This is usable for any OpenTTD servers


== CHANGELOG ==
